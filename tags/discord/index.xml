dodgy public Wi-Fis and networks operated by my Airbnb hosts. Under
such circumstances I prefer tunneling all my traffic through VPN to
avoid eavesdropping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a long time I&amp;rsquo;ve had an always-on beefy VPS with OpenVPN running so this
wasn&amp;rsquo;t an issue. However, a while back I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to save some money
by scaling it down to a very small instance and running bigger workloads
(VPN included) on ephemeral instances.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
