about commenting on this blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to introduce some commenting functionality as some of my posts (like this
one!) are meant to help others facing similar issues and having the ability to
ask/respond might benefit others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m also planning on writing about stuff where I feel like I don&amp;rsquo;t have a good
enough solution and would like to get feedback from others.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
