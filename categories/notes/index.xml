great software for turning 2D images into 3D prints. I&amp;rsquo;ve experimented with it a
little bit, and got some nice results. Here&amp;rsquo;s the very first image I&amp;rsquo;ve tried
and the result I got:&lt;/p>


&lt;div style="text-align: center;">

&lt;p>I was sceptical going into this: why use a 3D printer to print something 2D?!
I changed my mind quickly. There&amp;rsquo;s something satisfying about transforming
a 2D image into a physical, three-dimensional object.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On-demand VPN</title><link>https://dvoros.com/posts/on-demand-vpn/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 16:51:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dvoros.com/posts/on-demand-vpn/</guid><description>&lt;p>For about a month now I&amp;rsquo;ve been travelling abroad and been surviving on
dodgy public Wi-Fis and networks operated by my Airbnb hosts. Under
such circumstances I prefer tunneling all my traffic through VPN to
avoid eavesdropping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a long time I&amp;rsquo;ve had an always-on beefy VPS with OpenVPN running so this
wasn&amp;rsquo;t an issue. However, a while back I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to save some money
by scaling it down to a very small instance and running bigger workloads
(VPN included) on ephemeral instances.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Commenting Metapost</title><link>https://dvoros.com/posts/commenting-metapost/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 16:51:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dvoros.com/posts/commenting-metapost/</guid><description>&lt;p>Okay, okay, not really a metapost as this isn&amp;rsquo;t a post about posts but a post
about commenting on this blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to introduce some commenting functionality as some of my posts (like this
one!) are meant to help others facing similar issues and having the ability to
ask/respond might benefit others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m also planning on writing about stuff where I feel like I don&amp;rsquo;t have a good
enough solution and would like to get feedback from others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bikes and Parking Places</title><link>https://dvoros.com/posts/bikes-and-parking-places/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 13:41:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dvoros.com/posts/bikes-and-parking-places/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of saving years of seemingly useless data and then trying to make
sense of it. If I see a (sort-of) publicly available datasource that I can
scrape and save I jump on it. It started with bike and moped sharing and
later continued with &amp;ldquo;smart parking&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain the process of finding, obtaining and archiving
these datasets and will follow up with analysis later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Saving endangered YouTube videos</title><link>https://dvoros.com/posts/youtube-backup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 15:17:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dvoros.com/posts/youtube-backup/</guid><description>&lt;p>Remember that video that you thought was funny ten years ago but didn&amp;rsquo;t age well
enough to stay on YouTube? I do too and I hate that I can&amp;rsquo;t find it anymore! To
avoid this from happening again, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to save my favorites to a playlist
and regularly back it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a short shell script &lt;code>cron&lt;/code>&amp;rsquo;d to run every morning on a
&lt;a href="https://www.scaleway.com">Scaleway&lt;/a> server that saves new additions to
&lt;a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/">Object Storage&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
